# Chi-Square-Test
Running a Chi-Square Test of Independence

##Model Interpretation for Chi-Square Tests:
When examining the association between 2005 Suicide per 100,000 (categorical response) and 2008 urban population rate (categorical explanatory), a chi-square test of independence revealed that suicide dependence with urbanrate was weak. 
chi-square value is 8.00, p value is 0.533.


##Model Interpretation for post hoc Chi-Square Test results:
A Chi Square test of independence revealed that Suicide per 100,000 and urban population rate  were NOT associated, X2 =8.00, p=0.533.

Post hoc comparisons of Suicide # dependence by urban population revealed that 50%tile of urban rate which is 74% mean and 75%tile of urban rate which is 100% has the highest association among the urban rate quatile group, X2 =5.00, p=0.171.
