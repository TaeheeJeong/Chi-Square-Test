Running a Chi-Square Test of Independence

##Model Interpretation for Chi-Square Tests:
When examining the association between lifetime major depression (categorical response) and past year nicotine dependence (categorical explanatory), a chi-square test of independence revealed that among daily, young adults smokers (my sample), those with past year nicotine dependence were more likely to have experienced major depression in their lifetime(36.2%) compared to those without past year nicotine dependence (12.7%), X2 =88.60, 1 df, p=0001.
The df or degree of freedom we record is the number of levels of the explanatory variable -1. Here the df is 1 nicotine dependence which has 2 levels (df 2-1=1).


##Model Interpretation for post hoc Chi-Square Test results:
A Chi Square test of independence revealed that among daily, young adult smokers (my sample), number of cigarettes smoked per day (collapsed into 5 ordered categories) and past year
nicotine dependence (binary categorical variable) were significantly associated, X2 =45.16, 4 df, p=.0001.
Post hoc comparisons of rates of nicotine dependence by pairs of cigarettes per day categories revealed that higher rates of nicotine dependence were seen among those smoking more cigarettes, up to 11 to 15 cigarettes per day. In comparison, prevalence of nicotine dependence was statistically similar among those groups smoking 10 to 15, 16 to 20, and > 20 cigarettes per day.
